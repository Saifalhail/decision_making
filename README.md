# Decision Making Alogirthm

This is the algorithm for decision making that uses genetic algorithm in order to solve scenario cases regarding deployment of assets within stations

# Running the algorithm

--> Start by running decision_making.py
--> Enter number of situations: This is how many scenarios. Typically as within the excel file each scenario was alone so it should be 1.
(int value)
--> Enter Distance from station A
(int value)
--> Enter Distance from station B
(int value)
--> Enter Situation from these values:
'oil', 'chemical', 'electrical', 'injury-serious',
'injury-light', 'robbery', 'breakin', 'traffic accident', 'traffic control'
Note Case sensitive.
--> Enter Solution needed from these values:
'supress', 'control', 'evacuate', 'investigate', 'arrest'
Note Case sensitive.
--> Enter size of situation from these values:
'small', 'medium', 'large'
Note Case sensitive
--> Enter Maximum time it takes to reach:
(int value)
Results will be printed out + graph.
